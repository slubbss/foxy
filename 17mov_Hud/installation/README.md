# Automatic Installation
17mov_Hud resource has an automatic installer feature. That means you can integrate HUD automatically with your framework with no really touching nothing.
To use this kind of installation you need to open `Config.lua` file and just set `Config.Autoinstall = true`. Then you just need to restart server/resource and follow messages into server console.
After that you can already enjoy our HUD resource.
**NOTE:** Automatic Installer feature has been broken by resource sandboxing at server side that has been added by CFX team to server artefacts. It has been added into versions: 11364 (Linux) and 11353 (Windows), so if you are using this or grater versions this feature is not avabile for you - you need to do "Manual Installation" (steps bellow).
